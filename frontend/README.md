# My Vue Express App

This project is a full-stack application built with Vue.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. Below are the instructions for setting up and running both parts of the application.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using Vue.js. It is responsible for the user interface and communicates with the backend API.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.

### Build

To build the frontend for production, run:
```
npm run build
```
The built files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Backend

The backend is built using Express.js. It handles API requests and serves data to the frontend.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
